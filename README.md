Project Description:
Radisson Blu hotel management system is a valuable asset for hoteliers looking to streamline their daily operations, improve guest experiences, and increase profitability. This software solution enables hotel staff to manage room reservations, view real-time availability, and allocate rooms to guests, simplifying room inventory management. The system also facilitates housekeeping tasks, manages guest requests and complaints, and tracks feedback to enhance the overall guest experience. With billing and payment functionality, the system simplifies payment management and invoicing, reducing errors in financial operations. The software's accessibility from any device with an internet connection provides hotel staff with the flexibility to manage their operations from anywhere, making it a reliable tool for hoteliers. Overall, a hotel management system is a valuable tool that improves efficiency, enhances guest experiences, and helps hotels increase their profitability. There are 3-types of Users here. They are:

Admin: The person in charge, who is commonly known as the Admin, is responsible for managing the system. To access the dashboard, the Admin must first register and log in. The Admin can view user profiles, change passwords, and update names. In addition to these tasks, the Admin is responsible for adding, editing, and removing items. The Admin also knows each user's access details. Using Ajax technology, the Admin can easily search for information about employees and products.

Customer: A customer is an individual who books a room online. The system generates a reservation confirmation and sends it to the customer. They can also request additional services or report issues through the system. During their stay, customers can view and pay bills online. The system provides customers with a convenient and user-friendly platform, enhancing their overall experience.

Moderator: The Moderator manages the products and must register and log in to access the dashboard. The Moderator can view profiles, update names and profile pictures, and search for and edit product information. However, adding, editing, and removing products is the responsibility of the Administrator. It's important to note that the Moderator doesn't have access to the list of users or employees.
